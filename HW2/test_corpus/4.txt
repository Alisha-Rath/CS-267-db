To calculate proximity scoring, a cover for such query is a sequence of
terms and phrases from a document that would satisfy the query such that
no smaller sequence would also satisfy the same query.
So for a document "bad good dog good cat dog bad" only the
sub-sequences "bad good dog good cat" would be a cover.
